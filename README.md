<h1>JavaScript Projects</h1>

These are some basic projects I have created with the programming language, JavaScript.

<h2>Projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Calculator</li>
  <li>Pizza Project</li>
  <li>Tic Tac Toe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculator</h2>
This project features a fully functioning calculator using methods and functions from Javascript, and style design in HTML, and CSS. 

<h2>Pizza Project</h2>
In this project I created an online form where a customer can select a pizza size and add toppings.  The site will then print a receipt based off of the type and quantity of toppings.

<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2> 
In this project I created a fully functioning game of tic tac toe using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
